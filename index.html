          THE COLLEGE DROPOUT IS THE DEBUT STUDIO ALBUM BY AMERICAN RAPPER KANYE WEST. IT WAS RELEASED ON FEBRUARY 10, 2004, THROUGH ROC-A-FELLA RECORDS. IT WAS RECORDED OVER A PERIOD OF FOUR YEARS, BEGINNING IN 1999. PRIOR TO THE ALBUM'S RELEASE, WEST HAD RECEIVED
          PRAISE FOR HIS PRODUCTION WORK FOR ARTISTS SUCH AS JAY-Z AND TALIB KWELI, BUT FACED DIFFICULTY BEING ACCEPTED AS A RECORDING ARTIST IN HIS OWN RIGHT BY FIGURES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. NONETHELESS INTENT ON PURSUING A SOLO CAREER, IT WAS SEVERAL
          YEARS BEFORE WEST FINALLY RECEIVED A RECORD DEAL FROM ROC-A-FELLA RECORDS.

          LATE REGISTRATION IS THE SECOND STUDIO ALBUM BY AMERICAN HIP HOP PRODUCER AND RAPPER KANYE WEST. IT WAS RECORDED OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR IN SESSIONS HELD ACROSS STUDIOS IN NEW YORK CITY AND HOLLYWOOD, WITH WEST COLLABORATING WITH AMERICAN RECORD PRODUCER
          AND COMPOSER JON BRION. THE ALBUM FEATURES GUEST CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ADAM LEVINE, LUPE FIASCO, JAMIE FOXX, COMMON, JAY-Z, BRANDY, AND NAS, AMONG OTHERS. ITS PRODUCTION WAS NOTABLY MORE LUSH AND ELABORATE THAN WEST'S 2004 DEBUT ALBUM THE COLLEGE
          DROPOUT, AS HE UTILIZED INTRICATE SAMPLING METHODS AND STRING ORCHESTRATION WITH BRION. WEST'S LYRICS EXPLORE BOTH PERSONAL AND POLITICAL THEMES, INCLUDING POVERTY, DRUG TRAFFICKING, RACISM, HEALTHCARE, AND THE BLOOD DIAMOND TRADE.

          CALIFORNIA AND AVEX RECORDING STUDIO IN HONOLULU, HAWAII, WITH THE HELP OF PRODUCERS NO I.D., JEFF BHASKER AND OTHERS. CONCEIVED IN THE WAKE OF A SERIES OF DISTRESSING PERSONAL EVENTS, 808S & HEARTBREAK MARKED A MAJOR MUSICAL DEPARTURE FOR WEST
          FROM HIS PREVIOUS RAP RECORDS, INSTEAD FEATURING A SPARSE, ELECTRONIC SOUND AND WEST SINGING THROUGH AN AUTO-TUNE VOCAL PROCESSOR. HIS LYRICS EXPLORED THEMES OF LOSS, ALIENATED FAME, AND HEARTACHE, WHILE THE ALBUM'S PRODUCTION ABANDONED CONVENTIONAL
          HIP HOP SOUNDS IN FAVOR OF A MINIMALIST SONIC PALETTE, WHICH INCLUDED PROMINENT USE OF THE TITULAR ROLAND TR-808 DRUM MACHINE.</p>

MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY IS THE FIFTH STUDIO ALBUM BY AMERICAN RAPPER KANYE WEST, RELEASED ON NOVEMBER 22, 2010, BY ROC-A-FELLA RECORDS. FOLLOWING A PERIOD OF PUBLIC AND LEGAL CONTROVERSY, WEST RETREATED TO A "SELF-IMPOSED EXILE" IN HAWAII IN
          2009. THERE, HE WORKED ON THE ALBUM IN A COMMUNAL RECORDING ENVIRONMENT THAT INVOLVED NUMEROUS CONTRIBUTING MUSICIANS AND PRODUCERS. THE ALBUM FEATURES GUEST APPEARANCES FROM BON IVER, JAY-Z, PUSHA T, RICK ROSS, KID CUDI, NICKI MINAJ, JOHN LEGEND
          AND MORE. PRODUCTION WAS LED BY WEST HIMSELF, ALONGSIDE A VARIETY OF HIGH-PROFILE RECORD PRODUCERS INCLUDING MIKE DEAN, NO I.D., JEFF BHASKER, RZA, S1, BINK AND DJ FRANK E. NOTED BY CRITICS FOR ITS MAXIMALIST AESTHETIC, OPULENT PRODUCTION QUALITY,
          AND DICHOTOMOUS THEMES, MY BEAUTIFUL DARK TWISTED FANTASY INCORPORATES ASPECTS OF WEST'S PREVIOUS WORKS, INCLUDING SOUL, BAROQUE, ELECTRO, AND SYMPHONIC STYLES. THE ALBUM DEALS WITH THEMES OF EXCESS AND CELEBRITY, AND EXPLORES SUCH ISSUES AS
          CONSUMER CULTURE, RACE, AND THE IDEALISM OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.

          YEEZUS IS THE SIXTH STUDIO ALBUM BY AMERICAN RAPPER KANYE WEST. IT WAS RELEASED ON JUNE 18, 2013, BY DEF JAM RECORDINGS. YEEZUS HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS WEST'S MOST EXPERIMENTAL AND SONICALLY ABRASIVE WORK. IT DRAWS FROM AN ARRAY OF GENRES, INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL, ACID HOUSE, ELECTRO, DANCEHALL, PUNK, AND CHICAGO DRILL. IT ALSO CONTINUES WEST'S UNCONVENTIONAL USE OF SAMPLES, AS ON "BLOOD ON THE LEAVES," WHICH PROMINENTLY INTERPOLATES NINA SIMONE'S 1965 RENDITION OF "STRANGE FRUIT". THE RELEASE FEATURES NO ALBUM ARTWORK, AND THE PHYSICAL CD EDITION OF THE ALBUM WAS RELEASED IN A CLEAR JEWEL BOX WITH ONLY A STRIP OF RED TAPE AND SAMPLE CREDITS. INITIAL PROMOTION OF YEEZUS INCLUDED WORLDWIDE VIDEO PROJECTIONS OF THE ALBUM'S MUSIC AND LIVE TELEVISION PERFORMANCES. WEST RELEASED TWO SINGLES FROM THE ALBUM, THE SONG "BLACK SKINHEAD" IN JULY 2013 AND "BOUND 2" THE FOLLOWING MONTH. </p>
